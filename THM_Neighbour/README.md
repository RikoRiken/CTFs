### 1. Visiting the website

Firstly, we can start by visiting the website with the IP provided by the machine : **http://MACHINE_IP**

We land on a login page with a message to uwse guest account if we don't already have an account.

By chekcing the source code of this page, we discover two things :  
- To connect as a guest, we can use **guest:guest** credentials,
- the admin account is *"out of limits!!!!!"*
